We created this tool for researchers working in Vietnam's Mekong Delta who need a map to show where they collected their data.

Clone or download our [VietnamMapPyGMT](https://github.com/hoanglongcao/VietnamMapPyGMT){:target="_blank"} repository and run `MapGUI.py`.

{% include github_repo.html %}

    fetchGitHubRepoDetails(repoUrl);
});
