### why <latex>LaTeX</latex> and <overleaf>Overleaf</overleaf>?

The main benefit of using LaTeX for writing papers is that it *simplifies switching journal templates* if your paper is rejected, though some journals now allow template-free submissions. [<overleaf>Overleaf</overleaf>](https://overleaf.com/){:target="_blank"} is an online tool for collaborative writing in LaTeX. For inspiration on using LaTeX in the humanities and social sciences, check out [this post](https://www.overleaf.com/blog/636-guest-blog-post-latex-for-the-humanities){:target="_blank"}.

If a journal requires a Word document, download your paper as PDF, then open it in Microsoft Word and save it as a `.docx`. If Overleaf doesn't suit your team, [Google Docs](https://docs.google.com/){:target="_blank"} is a good alternative.

### openTexi <overleaf>Overleaf</overleaf> templates

You can join [this Overleaf project](https://www.overleaf.com/read/xxshpzxxvfxf#11271f){:target="_blank"}  of us and then [copy it](https://www.overleaf.com/learn/how-to/Copying_a_project){:target="_blank"}  as a new project and start your work with the templates.

- `main.tex` -- main manuscript file
- other files for submission
	- `cover letter to editor.tex`
	- `highlights.tex`
	- `response to reviewers.tex`
- `main-r1` -- revision #1
	- `latexmkrc` -- for track changes
